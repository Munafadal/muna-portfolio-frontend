# Fix: GitHub Save Button Not Working

## Quick Solutions

### Solution 1: Try "All Repositories" Instead

Instead of selecting individual repositories:

1. **Select "All repositories"** (the first radio button)
2. **Click "Save"**
3. This is easier and should work better

### Solution 2: Check if It Actually Saved

Sometimes the save works but there's no visual feedback:

1. **Refresh the GitHub page** (F5)
2. **Check if the repository is still selected**
3. If it is, the save worked!

### Solution 3: Hard Refresh

Clear browser cache:

1. **Press:** `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. **Try saving again**

### Solution 4: Check Browser Console

1. **Press F12** to open developer tools
2. **Click the "Console" tab**
3. **Look for red error messages**
4. If you see errors, try a different browser

### Solution 5: Try Different Browser

Sometimes browser extensions interfere:

1. **Try Chrome, Firefox, or Edge**
2. **Or try incognito/private mode**

## Alternative: Skip GitHub Settings

If the save button keeps not working:

1. **Go back to Amplify Console**
2. **The repository might already be connected**
3. **Try clicking the refresh icon** in Amplify
4. **See if the repository appears in the dropdown**

The repository might already be accessible even if the save button doesn't seem to work.

## Quick Test

1. **Go back to Amplify Console**
2. **Click the refresh icon** (circular arrow) next to repository dropdown
3. **Click the dropdown**
4. **See if `muna-portfolio-frontend` appears**

If it appears, you're good to go! The save might have worked even without visual feedback.

## Nuclear Option: Uninstall and Reinstall

If nothing works:

1. **Scroll down to "Danger zone"**
2. **Click "Uninstall"**
3. **Go back to Amplify**
4. **Start the setup process again**
5. **This time, select "All repositories" from the start**
